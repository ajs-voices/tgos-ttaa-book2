# A Gym Tryst

Another thirty floors down to the gym to find my brother kissing the fucking blond who had hit on me earlier. I cleared my throat. The blonde, Sandy was her name I thought, turned first and she got bright red. "You realize you are kissing a sixteen year old boy." I didn't think the pale woman could get any redder but she did. "You did realized that? Then you won't mind me telling the cops."

"I... " She stammered.  

But Rider interrupted, "Nox come on man. You don't have to do that. She won't touch me again." He looked at her hard and she nodded. "See, she won't."

"I don't believe it Rider. She's at least a twenty something fucking a sixteen year old."

"We were only kissing," she blurted out.

"You want me to believe you got that red because you were kissing a boy? Please."  I looked at Rider. "Do you need to hop a plane to join your father?"

Rider went pale. "No, sir. I promise **I** won't do it again."

I looked at the women. "I see you around my boys one more time, any of them and I'm not telling you who **my** boys consist of and I'll call the cops and my brother will confess because he'll do the right thing. That's how he was raised."  

She looked at me with fear, and I knew the look. I'd seen it many times before. The same look the supernatural give me when I make threats I'll carry out. But she left in a hurry and I wouldn't be surprised if she never looked at anyone from my apartment again.

"Holy fuck," Alex said softly.

I turned to look at him. He pulled his lips in and frowned. "I've seen you be all big bad and scary but that was new."

Rider laughed, "You must be Alex. I'm Rider, and I'm going to go sit outside of the apartment door until Lake is done fucking his boyfriend." He was tattling on his brother.

Alex snorted, he knew it too. "I know. I told him to lock the bedroom door. The living room should be safe. Please go inside, we'll talk about this later."

"Yes, sir," he said and he left without another word.

"I'm going to say I don't think I've heard anyone yes, sir you as much as I have today."

"My brothers were raised to respect their elders and my house my rules. They like my rules."

"What rule did he break?"

"He didn't break one specifically. What sixteen year old boy isn't going to say yes when an older woman comes on to him? She wanted to fuck me the last time I was down here with her. And I can tell this wasn't the first time with Rider."

Alex's mouthed, "Ah." He pulled me towards the door. "I could make her stay away from him."

I shook my head. "I'm pretty sure she believes me when I said I'd call in statutory rape.  Consenting sixteen year olds isn't a thing."

"You'd really do that?"

"I have rules."

"What rule did she break?"

"You don't fuck kids no matter how cute and or consenting they are."

Alex nodded, "Reasonable rule. What other rules do you have."

"Too many, but you don't fuck married people, single parents, or someone in a relationship." I sighed. "It's sometimes hard to know, but once I find out it's done.  Not that I actually sleep with someone more than once."

We walked in silence for a while. "You know I fit two out of four of those rules."

I stopped in the middle of the sidewalk as it sank in. Unless Alex was being a sarcastic git, he was married and had a kid. "I think you need to tell me. Now."

Alex nodded and took my hand, "Coffee?"

I followed numbly after him. We went into the coffee shop on the way to the AU building. We ordered coffee. Rather, Alex ordered my coffee and his and a chocolate brownie. He didn't ask me if I wanted it. He knew my fondness of chocolate and it was meant to soften the blow.

We sat down and waited for our coffee but we didn't talk. It wasn't until we got our order that Alex started speaking. "I'm not married anymore. It was a long con. My mother was really aiming high on this one. It was our last con together. We wanted her fortune. She a young heiress to some tech throne or another not real bright. It wasn't hard to make her fall in love and a month in I asked her to marry me. She said yes. It was all great, living in that big house with my mom. But then there was a car accident, my wife asked me to stay home, she had news to tell me, but we were going to go to the bank and transfer all the funds to an account and mom's car got hit by another car. I was supposed to be in it. Shelly, that was her name, she told me she was pregnant that day. She was so excited. I didn't know she was trying for a kid. I was just a kid I shouldn't be having a kid. And then my mom died and I pretty much bailed. On her, the kid, the con. I had the marriage annulled before the kid was born."

Alex barrelled through it all and I could see his face reflect his worst nightmare. This was the most he'd ever talked about himself and for the horrible story it was it could have been a lot worse. And when he was done he stood up and started to walk away. I caught his hand, "Where are you going?"

"I don't want to hear you break up with me," he said.

"I'm breaking up with you? Because of something you did in your past?" I asked him confused. "Alex, you aren't married now are you?" He shook his head. "Then okay I'm a little upset you didn't tell me before. But I didn't ask either. And this is the first time something like that came up. Why are you so ready to make this end?"

Alex stared at me from above. He was still waiting for the other shoe to drop  "Alex, you were a boy. You said it yourself. Please sit down."
