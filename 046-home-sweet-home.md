# Home Sweet Home?

The City came into view and I started having a panic attack. My heart was racing and I was sweating like crazy. I was fucking going crazy at what ifs. What if Laker and Rider didn't want to stay with me. What if the twins hated me? What if Dorian refused my requests? What if Garrett was behind it all.  What if....

Alex pulled over at the next exit and into a gas station. "Pretty boy?"

"I'm alright."

"You don't look alright."

I sighed. "What ifs..."

Alex shook his head. "Why do you worry about things you can't control?"

"Because that's just me."

"How can I help?" Alex asked.

"We need to get home for you to help." I frowned. "I just need a quiet place and you." I wrapped my hand in his. "I'm okay. Let's just go home."

Alex sat there staring at me for several long minutes watching as I tried to calm myself.  He started Serenity again and headed back out to the highway and on to the City. It was quiet but Alex's hand was warm in mine. I focused on that until Alex was cursing at the traffic.

We were almost home, but it took another hour before we would make it back to Alex's apartment.

The familiar sites of home came into view as we pulled into the parking garage that was Serenity's home. Alex ran his fingers over her door and leaned down and whispered to her, "I'll send Bobby by to pick you up and give you a good cleaning."

"You don't clean her yourself?  I asked.

Alex gave me this look like I was crazy. "Here in the City where there is a guy for that?"

I laughed, "There is a guy for everything. I guess that makes sense."

I grabbed my bag of new things from the trunk and Alex grabbed a bag. "Come up, clean up and I'll take you home?"

I nodded. "You know, I knew this was coming. That once we got here we'd go our separate ways." I grinned at Alex as I took his free hand. "Not permanently, but because we already agreed. Slow and steady. Not barrelling through like we had been. Though I'm not sure I'll like sleeping alone in my bed."

Alex laughed, "We might have to ease into that."

"What sharing a bed?"

"No. Sleeping alone."

"I need to get home. My brothers have been at my place alone with only my father and Dorian checking on them periodically."

Alex laughed. "It's still standing, they didn't throw any parties."

"How do you know?"

"I've been following them on all their social media. Stalking you."

"So maybe they didn't take any pictures. Evidence and all."

Alex was shaking his head. "I don't think so, they take pictures of everything. It's the millennial thing to do. Next they will be growing beards." Alex grinned at me as he pushed the button for the elevator.

"Uh huh." I just nodded. He was poking fun at me. "Maybe I'll just shave then."

Alex grabbed my chin and ran his fingers down my jawline with his fingers. "That would be alright with me. Smooth skin." His voice was starting to sound breathless. "No scratching my thighs when you suck my cock. No hair caught between my teeth when I do this." He leaned forward and nibbled at my ear and down my jawline to his favorite spot on my neck.

The elevator came and was devoid of people as we stepped on to go up to Alex's apartment.  He backed me up against the wall and pressed his body to mine.  "Not that I mind the hair and scratching. You are mine no matter what, pretty boy."

"You have no preference?"

Alex sucked on my neck and distracted me from my train of thought. The door chimed and Alex glanced up at the number even as someone walked into the car with us. But Alex returned to his spot pressed against my neck. He pushed a thought in my head.  _Quiet and they won't look at what we are doing_ My body stiffened at the the request and he was right, no one turned around but I was hard and fighting back the sounds that wanted to escape with my pleasure.

One man watched out of the corner of his eye. And from the look of the boner in his pants he was enjoying it. The doors dinged open to Alex's floor and we stepped off.  I winked at the guy who'd been watching us and he blushed. Alex chuckled, "Such a fucking flirt."

"He was the one getting off on watching us."

Alex turned around to walk backwards to see the guy but the doors had already closed.  "You like that? Being watched I mean."

I shrugged. "Not really, it happens though. I mean how could they not. Me, and you." I licked my finger and touched Alex and made a sizzling sound with a bright grin.

Alex rolled his eyes. "I don't like sharing you."

I laughed. "Yet you suck on my neck in a crowded elevator. I'm sure I'll be sporting this new hickey for a few hours."

"I hate that you know," Alex said shoving his key in the door then handed it to me. "Your key."

"I know. I can't do anything about it though. I heal too fast for you to keep me marked."  I grinned at Alex. "I could tattoo your name across my neck, so it would stay."

Alex looked at me like it was a thought but instead started for his bedroom. I set my bags down at the door and followed him. "Do you want a shower?" He shouted from his room.

"I need to call D first see if it's going to break his rules if I come by to see the twins."

"That didn't answer my question Nox." Alex stepped into the door way and look at me sternly.

"I'd love a shower, with you in it too."

Alex smirked. "I might be able to help you out with that. Make the call quick, doesn't take long for the water to heat up." Alex turned back into his room and left me to make my call.

Dorian's phone rang twice before he picked up. "Nox. I haven't heard from you in a while.  I see you found Alex."

"About that, why didn't you tell me I had kids."

"Same reason I didn't tell your father, the mother asked me not to."

I sighed, "Do they know?"

"I wanted you to be here when I told them."

"Can I tell them? Today? I need to grab a shower and change, and then I'll be over - with Alex."

"Sure Nox. But why do I get the feeling that's not all you wanted." Dorian had always understood me even if he hadn't loved me early on. And even on the phone he knew something was up.

"I need to talk with Garrett. I need to bring Ant with me, and Alex." The last was a whispered notion. I didn't want to take Alex.


"You need back up?" Dorian asked.

"Not so much backup as a just in case. Alex won't let me talk to my former torturer and I don't want him near Garrett at all, our compromise is to both go with Ant as back up."

I knew Dorian was frowning.  "Why do you need to talk to him?"

"I just do Dorian. It's a long story, I'll tell you but not over the phone."

"Fine. Come see me, we'll talk. Then you can see the twins and deliver the news and hopefully by then I'll have an answer for you about bringing The Hound's Son into the AU building to talk to one of our esteemed mentors."

"Thank you D."

Dorian growled, "We'll see." And then he hung up. Not two seconds later he sent me a text:

D: He's sorry.  We love you.  So glad you found happiness. ~M_

I was smiling when I entered Alex's room to go find this shower we were talking about.
