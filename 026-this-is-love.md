# This Is Love

Alex was groaning at the bathroom, so I followed him inside and it was a little gross.  I pulled Alex back out of the bathroom and wrapped my arms around him.  "Go get some food.  Something that will still be decent cold if we get distracted."

He looked at me with a frown.  "I will make this better."

"I'm not worried about me."  Alex confessed.

I laughed, "I'll make it better."

Alex looked at me long and hard trying to figure things out without reading me, "Go.  I'm okay.  I promise.  I want to be naked for you so hurry back."

Which made Alex grunt before he turned around and left me alone with the subpar motel room.  At least it was roach free.  Hopefully bedbug free too.  But I'd fix that too.   At least temporarily.

Cleaning was easy.  The drapes, the carpets, the floors and bedding were easy to clean off anything that might be soiled.  I figured it was better than making all new ones.  And it was faster.  The bathroom was a little gross but it was amazing what a little hot water and sand can do for things like a tub and grout.  Though I was careful not to let the sand out of my control.  Last thing we needed was my freak outs.

Everything was as clean as it was going to get by the time Alex came in with two boxes of pizza.  He looked around and grinned at me, "It smells better, it feels better."

"It's amazing what dusting can do."

"You are such a neat freak."  He said after setting the pizza on the table then came over to me.  Alex wrapped his arms around my waist, "Thank you.  I didn't want to lose you..."

I pressed a kiss to his lip to keep him quiet.  "I would have been fine as long as you were with me.  I can do anything with you."  And it was the truth.

"You are so cheezy."  Alex smirked.

"Oh am I?"  I said pulling away, but Alex didn't let go of my hips and pulled me back against him.  "You said I'm cheezy."

He pressed a kiss to my lips.  "Yep."  His lips trailed down my jawline and his teeth sank into my neck pulling a groan from my throat.  I tilted my head to the side and Alex sucked an worried at his favorite spot and I was melting in his arms.  

I laughed though it came out more a groan and croak than  laugh, "Now all melty cheesy."

Alex pushed me away and laughed.  "Are you hungry?"

"A little."  I said.  "Probably should get some energy.  I have some very specific plans tonight."

"Oh really?"  Alex asked, but he was already reaching for the pizza box.  He tossed it on the bed, "Tell me about these specific plans."

I sat down on the bed and opened the box to find my favorite pizza staring back at me.  I didn't much like the carbs of pizza, the crust was harsh usually, but I liked a few slices, but sitting in front of me was a New York style pizza crispy enough on the bottom that the toppings didn't break it covered in tomatoes, basil and mozzarella.  Very little sauce if any and covered in spinach that was lightly saute in garlic from the smell of it.  I reached across the box and grabbed Alex's t-shirt.  With a simple little tug Alex was leaning over the box and I was kissing him.

Alex laughed when he broke away, "I'm glad you like it pretty boy.  It was annoying to get them to make it at all."

"Thank you for going through that extra effort."

His smile was bright and his blue eyes were sparkling.  "Anything for you."

I bit my bottom lip and stared at him.  My heart was racing I wanted to say more.  Alex was picking up a slice and I followed suit.  I wanted to tell him how I felt, but he might bolt if I did that.  I didn't want that.  I just wanted him with me - forever, but he didn't need to know that.

Alex asked, "What's going through your head?"

"Just thinking about you."

"You got afraid for a moment."  Alex said.

"Was thinking if I said something you might run away.  And that I didn't want that."

Alex sighed, "Nothing you can say will make me run away?"

I laughed, "Uh huh.  So if I told you I wanted to murder you in your sleep you wouldn't run away?"

Alex smirked.  "I'd love to see you try.  Really, tell me.  No secrets."  

I took a deep breath and closed my eyes.  "I was just thinking how much I loved you, and how much I wanted to tell you."  I ate my pizza without looking up to see what Alex thought of the thought.

"And you don't want to tell me?"  Alex asked.

I looked up, "Of course I do.  I don't want you to get scared.  I don't want you to think I'm trying to make you stay or that I'm desperate.  Or anything like that."  I sat closer though there was no reason to do so he wasn't that far away, "I fucking love you, so totally and epicly in love with you that I don't want you to leave me again.  I don't think I can handle it and I don't want to be the reason you leave."

Alex was opening his mouth but I took his pizza from his hand and set them both down in the box and I pressed a kissed to his mouth before he could say anything.  I didn't want to hear his rejection of the notion.  I just wanted him.  There was little left for him to say as he pushed me back on the bed and our hands were everywhere.  His mouth, my mouth, our fingers exploring bodies we knew inside out.  Sex always came easy.
