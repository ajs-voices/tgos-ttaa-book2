# Solving Problems

Alex rolled over on to his back and now I was looking down into those beautiful blue eyes of his. He looked better, there was a smirk on his face. "I don't know. I might forever." He paused to gauge my reaction. "Would that be so terrible?"

I shook my head. "No. Not terrible. But I liked you knowing what was going on in my head. Not so that you can see all the crazy, but so you can help stop it from becoming too much."

Alex sat up and I fell backwards to allow him the room. I got to stare up at him now. One of my favorite places to be. I licked my lips and Alex was shaking his head. "Is that why you are having a hard time the past few days, because I'm making it worse."

"It's not about you Alex. I know I'm a handful. And really all this will get better as time moves on, but when you can hear me going ape shit in my head you help me find a new path. And it might have stopped a few fights the last few days, if you could hear my thoughts, and how much I'm spiralling." I dropped my gaze. "But it's okay, Alex, you do what you need to do I can cope. I was just wondering is all."

Alex shimmied down so he was lying on his side and he pressed a kiss to my lips, more of a brush of his against mine, and I looked across at him and gave him a weak smile. "I know it's been hard. But this is working for now. You manage to know me without reading my mind. I should know you the same way." Alex smirked. "Been many times I wanted to just reach in and listen so I could fix you, or this, or that, or whatever was going on. It's hard for me. But you're talking to me - really talking, and I'm talking to you. We both have to try."

I sighed and laughed. "Fine. Fair game then."

Alex rolled over on top of me, pressing me into the bed with his weight and looking down at me with those sparkling blue eyes his elbows around my ears propping his head up.  "I'm glad we came here. I needed to talk to Kish."

"About what?" I asked.  

"About you actually." Alex smirked.

"What about me? I could have told you anything you wanted to know."

"It's not like that." Alex laughed, "It wasn't dating advice. That black blur, the creature thing I saw."

"You think you saw?"

Alex shook his head. "No Nox, I saw it. Real and truly, I saw it. And I told Kish about it.  We flipped through some of her dads old books, and we think we might know what it is."

I leaned up and brushed my lips against his. He captured them in a kiss and I felt like I was drowning in him. I wanted to drown in him. He broke the kiss, his face still close to mine as we breathed the same air. "Stop trying to distract me," Alex breathed against my lips.

"What is it Alex?" I asked curious. Though I was enjoying the man on top of me more than the curiosity.

Alex chuckled, "You'd rather be making out."

I smiled up at him and brushed my lips against his. "I'm just happy to be here with you.  I'm good, you talk, I'll listen and I promise I won't try to seduce you."

Alex licked my lips, "Baby..." He pressed his lips harder to mine and I groaned against him. My fingers grabbing his hips and holding him tight against me. We kissed and ground against each other until Alex pulled away and pressed a quick peck to my lips again. "It's something called a nightmare. You heard of it?"

I nodded. "There's a class on folk lore, all the myths and legends all over the world so we know what's what and who's who sorta thing. Nightmares go by a few different names, they are supposedly a creature that feasts on fear and nightmares."

"Any idea what they look like?" Alex asked.

I shook my head. "There were drawings and such, but no one's really seen on in a long time, and the Venatori don't really care."

"That's all that were in Kish's books. I think there was a way to kill it. But I'd need to see it again. I don't even know if it'll work." Alex sat up on my thighs and looked down on me with a frown. "You'd have to have that nightmare again. I hate seeing you like that."

"So what's one more nightmare, if you kill it and they are gone?" I grinned at Alex. "Lover, one more nightmare and we can dream whatever we want."

Alex was laughing at me, "You keep surprising me baby. Always so positive."

I grinned. "What more can I be. One more nightmare for a lifetime with you?"

"So cheesy." Alex leaned down and kissed me. "I think I might be able to reward you for your bravery."

I laughed, "I haven't been brave yet."

"You are always brave." Alex said as he pressed a kiss to my lips hard and fast. His teeth worried my bottom lip and I let him in. Kissing went into more of a frenzied make out session until we were naked and calling out each other's names.
