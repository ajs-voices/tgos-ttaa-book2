# I'll Fucking Kill Her (Alex)

The bathroom run was not surprising since Nox had been asleep for so long. And leaving him was easier now that I knew he was better. He wasn't stumbling or wincing when he moved. He had no bruising and I had looked. And he was hungry, I could feel the building pangs. But there was no way I was cooking for him.  

It wasn't long before Nox joined me. He was immediately in the kitchen and I stepped aside. His thoughts were so buried in thanking me later for the help that I hadn't heard Ant walk in with Sage and his wife. There were no introductions even though I'd never met either of them. Sage grinned at me before he walked around the bar and wrapped his arms around **my** boyfriend. He wasn't a threat, Nox was very open about that relationship. Even the snippet I saw about the one night they shared was just a blip. It was a twinge of jealousy until Sage's own thoughts were just as platonic. There was no sex, no romance, just safety in each other. And I knew Sage had needed Nox, and Nox needed him. Fuck I was being so accepting.

I glanced back at Nox and he was cutting into the cake. "What are you doing?"

"It's chocolate cake." Nox laughed.

Dee and Sage both laughed and I didn't hear anything they said as Nox explained.  _I like to eat my desert first because I don't have it very often. It's sorta a rule of mine._

Nox drooled over the piece Dee almost fed him which almost had me seeing green. She stepped close to him and kissed him and he stumbled back and there was a trail of black smoke between them as he fell to the floor. "Nox!" I was around the bar before anyone else including the vampires.

They were already detaining the woman that was Nox's bestfriend's wife. But Nox was lying on ground and I couldn't reach him. I glared at the woman. 

She was struggling against the new vampire's arms. I yelled, "What did you do?" 

Her eyes were wide and she was afraid, but other than the normal cues I couldn't read her either.  

Dee pleaded, "I didn't do anything." She looked to Sage. "What are we doing here?"

He was confused, "You suggested we bring Nox the cake you made him."

"I remember making the cake," Dee cried.

Fuck!

Ant was taking her away. Sage was following but he was having issues with Vin and he was starting to panic. "Dude, don't touch him. He doesn't like people to touch him."

The vampire held up his hands and backed away. "Sage you okay?" I asked.

He nodded while trying to catch his breathe. "Take care of Nox, I'll figure this out." He sounded very brave too. What was it with Nox and his friends.

I tried to reach him again and again, but there was nothing there, even touching him I couldn't get into his head. It was like there was a shield...

I looked back the way Ant had taken the girl. I saw into her head, she was completely confused, her emotions where everywhere and I couldn't actually decipher most of her thoughts, they were like Nox's at times. So all over, so foreign.

I wanted to talk to her but I didn't want to leave my pretty boy. I so wanted to hurt her for making me lose the connection Nox and I had worked so hard to figure out and now it was gone again. Fuck!

I pushed a message through to Ant. The only fucking person I trusted with Nox. _I need you to look after Nox._ He gave me a nod and the indication he'd be there as soon as he could. I didn't stay long enough to figure out what he was doing. I scooped Nox up into my arms - fuck he was heavier than he looked. The hall felt longer than it was carrying my pretty boy back to bed, but I made it. I pushed the door open and laid Nox down on the bed next to the puppy pile that was still in bed.

Cass stirred and was looking at her dad in horror and fear. "Is he dead?"

Those three little words pulled the rest of the kids awake. Everyone was looking at him.  Rider the voice of reason took Cass in his arms and spoke softly but not so loud that he startled anyone. "No, he's alive." He pointed to the rise and fall of his chest. "See he's breathing." He looked at me and frowned. "What happened? I thought he was better."

"He was. Sage brought his wife here, she kissed him and he fell into whatever this is."

Hunter took my hand and I pulled him into my arms. He wrapped his arms around me and whispered, "He's in a dream." Hunter was shaking. I curled an arm around him protectively and we all watched as Nox looked like he was sleeping peacefully, but Hunter was afraid, so very afraid. Whatever connection Nox had built with his children was in full effect with his son. Cass was scared but she was being comforted by Rider who was keeping everyone else's sanity.

Matt moved closer through the pile of people and touched Nox and his body convulsed like it was in pain. Hunter screamed in my ear and Matt jerked his hand away  "I won't do it again. I won't, I promise." He held his hand like it had hurt him.  

"Are you okay, Matt?" I asked even as Laker was taking his hand.

"He burnt me."

"He didn't when I touched him." Rider reached across and ran his fingers down his brother's cheek. "He's not hot."

Matt shook his head. "No, with his power, he burnt my hand. I saw the fire building around my hand but they can't touch me. Whatever is wrong it's protecting him from me, which means it's magical in nature."

I nodded, more and more I leaned towards the bitch. I was so fucking going to kill her.

Ant walked into the room. "I got him," he said. The vampire held out his hand for Hunter but the boy clung to me.

I shook my head. "I don't think he's leaving my neck while his father is in that dream."

Ant nodded. "She's locked up for now  Vin will show you the way. He won't leave your side so don't ask him to."

I nodded. "Of course." Hunter and I left Nox in the capable hands of his family and Doc who was jogging down the hall giving me a nod as he passed us.
